# Tower Upgrades Screen Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Tower Upgrades Screen for the Tower Defense game, inspired by BTD6's upgrade system. This feature allows players to browse all available towers and their multi-tier upgrade paths with exponential cost scaling based on difficulty.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Core Tower Upgrades Screen (`game/ui/tower_upgrades_screen.py`)
- **TowerCard class**: Interactive tower selection cards with hover effects
- **UpgradePathDisplay class**: Detailed upgrade information panel
- **TowerUpgradesScreen class**: Main controller managing the entire interface
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with main menu

### 2. Comprehensive Tower Data System (`data/towers.json`)
- **4 Tower Types**: Dart Tower, Sniper Tower, Bomb Tower, Ice Tower
- **Multi-Path Upgrades**: 3 paths × 5 tiers = 15 upgrades per tower
- **Exponential Scaling**: Costs increase progressively through tiers
- **Difficulty Multipliers**: E(1.0x), M(1.2x), H(1.5x), I(2.0x) cost scaling

### 3. Interactive Features
- **Tower Selection**: Click tower cards to view detailed upgrade paths
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Real-time cost calculation based on selected difficulty
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, selection highlighting, tier color coding
- **Navigation Controls**: Back button to return to main menu

### 4. Integration Points
- **Main Menu Integration**: "Towers" button launches upgrade screen
- **Screen Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup
- **Import System**: Clean module structure with proper dependencies
