# UI Layout Improvements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the UI layout of the Tower Defense game to fix overflow issues and improve visual presentation across multiple interface panels.

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### 1. Tower Upgrades Screen - Left Panel
**Problem**: Tower cards and content were cramped in the left sidebar
**Solution**: Expanded sidebar width from 300px to 380px (+80px)

### 2. Pause Menu - Button Overflow  
**Problem**: Four buttons (Resume, Settings, Main Menu, Quit Game) were overflowing the menu height
**Solution**: Expanded menu height from 350px to 400px (+50px)

### 3. Settings Menu - Text Overflow
**Problem**: "Auto Start Rounds" text and description were overflowing the menu width
**Solution**: Expanded menu width from 500px to 600px (+100px)

## 📐 Detailed Changes

### Tower Upgrades Screen (`game/ui/tower_upgrades_screen.py`)
```python
# Before
self.sidebar_width = 300

# After  
self.sidebar_width = 380  # Expanded by 80px
```

**Impact**:
- More spacious tower card layout
- Better visual breathing room for tower icons and names
- Improved readability of tower costs and descriptions
- Enhanced overall user experience in tower selection

### Pause Menu (`game/ui/pause_menu.py`)
```python
# Before
self.menu_height = 350

# After
self.menu_height = 400  # Expanded by 50px
```

**Impact**:
- Proper spacing for all four buttons
- No more button overlap or cramped layout
- Consistent button spacing throughout the menu
- Professional appearance with adequate margins

### Settings Menu (`game/ui/pause_menu.py`)
```python
# Before
self.menu_width = 500
self.auto_start_toggle_x = self.menu_x + self.menu_width - 60

# After
self.menu_width = 600  # Expanded by 100px
self.auto_start_toggle_x = self.menu_x + self.menu_width - 80  # Adjusted toggle position
```

**Impact**:
- Full text visibility for "Auto Start Rounds" label
- Proper spacing for setting description text
- Correctly positioned toggle checkbox
- No text truncation or overlap issues
