## Technical Implementation Details

### Classes Implemented

1. **BloonType (Enum)**: Defines bloon varieties
2. **BloonProperties (Dataclass)**: Bloon statistics
3. **Bloon**: Moving enemies with health and path following
4. **Projectile**: Tower ammunition with target tracking
5. **Tower**: Defensive structures with range and targeting
6. **Wave**: Manages bloon spawning for each level
7. **GameMap**: Handles map data and rendering
8. **GameUI**: User interface components
9. **TowerDefenseGame**: Main game controller

### Game Balance

- **Starting Resources**: $50 money, 20 lives
- **Tower Cost**: $10 per tower
- **Tower Stats**: 100 range, 1 damage, 1 shot/second
- **Bloon Types**: 4 varieties with scaling difficulty
- **Wave Progression**: 4 waves with increasing challenge

### Performance Features

- 60 FPS target with pygame.Clock
- Efficient object management and cleanup
- Optimized collision detection
- Memory-conscious projectile handling

### Controls

- **Left Click**: Place tower
- **SPACE**: Start next wave
- **ESC**: Quit game
