## Technical Implementation Details

### BTD6-Style Mechanics (Version 2.2.0)

#### Enhanced Tower System

- **Pierce Mechanics**: Projectiles track hit bloons and remaining pierce count
- **Multi-Projectile Support**: Towers can fire multiple projectiles per shot (Tack Shooter: 8 tacks)
- **Targeting Modes**: Four authentic BTD6 targeting options:
  - `first`: Targets bloon furthest along path
  - `last`: Targets bloon closest to start
  - `close`: Targets closest bloon to tower
  - `strong`: Targets bloon with highest health
- **Special Abilities**: Framework for camo detection, lead popping, seeking projectiles

#### Advanced Projectile System

- **Pierce Tracking**: Each projectile maintains `hit_bloons` set and `pierce_remaining` counter
- **Seeking Mechanics**: Projectiles can automatically track and seek targets
- **Realistic Collision**: Uses `bloon.size + 3` pixel radius instead of fixed 8-pixel hitbox
- **Directional Firing**: Support for specific patterns (e.g., Tack Shooter 360° spread)

#### Tower Selling Economics

- **BTD6 Formula**: Sell price = 70% of total money spent (rounded down)
- **Cost Tracking**: Tracks base cost + all upgrade costs through `total_spent` property
- **Real-time UI**: Sell price displayed and updated in upgrade panel
- **Controls**: X key or DELETE key to sell selected tower

#### Technical Implementation Examples

```python
# Enhanced Collision Detection
collision_radius = bloon.size + 3  # Realistic hit detection
if distance <= collision_radius:
    if bloon not in self.hit_bloons:
        bloon.take_damage(self.damage)
        self.hit_bloons.add(bloon)
        self.pierce_remaining -= 1

# Tower Targeting System  
def find_target(self, bloons):
    targets_in_range = [(b, self.distance_to(b)) for b in bloons if self.distance_to(b) <= self.range]
    if self.targeting_mode == "first":
        return max(targets_in_range, key=lambda x: x[0].path_position)[0]
    elif self.targeting_mode == "strong":
        return max(targets_in_range, key=lambda x: x[0].health)[0]

# Multi-Projectile Firing (Tack Shooter)
if self.tower_type == "tack_shooter":
    for i in range(8):  # 8 projectiles in circle
        angle = (2 * math.pi * i) / 8
        projectile = Projectile(x, y, angle, self.projectile_damage, self.pierce)
```

### Classes Implemented

1. **BloonType (Enum)**: Defines bloon varieties
2. **BloonProperties (Dataclass)**: Bloon statistics
3. **Bloon**: Moving enemies with health and path following
4. **Projectile**: Tower ammunition with target tracking
5. **Tower**: Defensive structures with range and targeting
6. **Wave**: Manages bloon spawning for each level
7. **GameMap**: Handles map data and rendering
8. **GameUI**: User interface components
9. **TowerDefenseGame**: Main game controller

### Game Balance

- **Starting Resources**: $50 money, 20 lives
- **Tower Costs**: Dart Monkey $200, Tack Shooter $280, Boomerang Monkey $325, Bomb Shooter $525
- **Tower Selling**: 70% of total money spent (BTD6 formula)
- **Tower Stats**: Authentic BTD6 pierce, projectiles, and targeting capabilities
- **Bloon Types**: 4 varieties with scaling difficulty
- **Wave Progression**: 4 waves with increasing challenge

### Performance Features

- 60 FPS target with pygame.Clock
- Efficient object management and cleanup
- Optimized collision detection using bloon visual size
- Memory-conscious projectile handling with pierce tracking

### Controls

- **Left Click**: Place tower / Select placed tower
- **SPACE**: Start next wave
- **TAB**: Cycle targeting modes (selected tower)
- **X / DELETE**: Sell selected tower
- **ESC**: Quit game
